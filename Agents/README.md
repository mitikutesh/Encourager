## Quick Reference

### For Coding Standards
- **[Coding Standards](rules/coding-standards.md)** - General coding practices for .NET and React
- **[Unit Testing Rules](rules/unit-testing.md)** - Test structure, naming, and patterns
- **[Documentation Rules](rules/documentation.md)** - Documentation standards and architecture diagrams
- **[Auto Documentation](rules/auto-documentation.md)** ⭐ **MANDATORY** - Automatic documentation updates with code changes

### For Implementation Guides
- **[Backend Setup](guides/backend-setup.md)** - .NET 10 API setup and structure
- **[Frontend Setup](guides/frontend-setup.md)** - React 19 setup and component structure
- **[PWA Implementation](guides/pwa-implementation.md)** - Progressive Web App setup
- **[Daily Blessing Rule](guides/daily-blessing-rule.md)** - One blessing per day logic
- **[Admin QR Generator](guides/admin-qr-generator.md)** - QR code generation for admin

### For Project Context
- **[Project Overview](context/project-overview.md)** - High-level project goals and tech stack
- **[Branding](context/branding.md)** - ECCFIN branding guidelines and color palette

## Usage

### For Cursor
Cursor will automatically read the `.cursorrules` file in the project root, which references this directory. All files in this directory are available for context.

### For Claude
Claude can read these markdown files directly. Reference specific files when needed:
- Use `context/` files for project understanding
- Use `rules/` files for coding standards
- Use `guides/` files for implementation steps

## File Categories

### Rules (`rules/`)
Standards and conventions that should be followed:
- Coding standards and best practices
- Testing requirements
- Documentation requirements

### Guides (`guides/`)
Step-by-step implementation instructions:
- Setup procedures
- Feature implementation
- Configuration details

### Context (`context/`)
Domain knowledge and project information:
- Branding guidelines
- Project overview
- Business rules

## Contributing

When adding new instructions:
1. **Rules** → Add to `rules/` if it's a standard or convention
2. **Guides** → Add to `guides/` if it's an implementation guide
3. **Context** → Add to `context/` if it's domain knowledge or project info
4. Update this README with links to new files

## Migration Notes

Old files in the root `Agents/` directory have been reorganized:
- `agent-instructions.md` → Split into `rules/documentation.md` and `rules/coding-standards.md`
- `vibe-instructions.md` → Merged into `context/project-overview.md`
- `project-context.md` → Merged into `context/project-overview.md`
- `eccfin-identity.md` + `branding-assets.md` → Consolidated into `context/branding.md`
- `persistence-rule.md` → Moved to `guides/daily-blessing-rule.md`
- `backend-setup.md` → Moved to `guides/backend-setup.md`
- `frontend-setup.md` → Moved to `guides/frontend-setup.md`
- `pwa-implementation.md` → Moved to `guides/pwa-implementation.md`
- `admin-qr.md` → Moved to `guides/admin-qr-generator.md`

Old files can be removed after confirming the new structure works correctly.
