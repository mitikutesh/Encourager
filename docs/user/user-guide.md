# User Guide

## Getting Started

### Accessing the App

1. **Scan QR Code**: Use your phone's camera to scan the QR code displayed at church
2. **Direct URL**: Visit the app URL directly in your browser
3. **Install PWA**: On supported devices, install the app to your home screen for easy access

### First Time Use

When you first open the app:

1. A random Bible verse will be displayed in your selected language
2. Read the verse and reflect on its meaning
3. Click the **"Amen"** button when you're ready to accept today's blessing
4. A celebration animation will play, confirming your blessing is locked in

## Daily Blessing Feature

### How It Works

- **One Blessing Per Day**: You receive one verse per day
- **Lock After "Amen"**: The verse is locked only after you click "Amen" (not on page load)
- **Reflection View**: If you've already received your blessing today, you'll see a reflection screen with:
  - Your saved verse
  - A countdown timer to midnight
  - Encouragement to reflect on the verse

### Understanding the Daily Limit

- The blessing resets automatically at midnight (your local time)
- You can read the verse multiple times before clicking "Amen"
- Once you click "Amen", you cannot get a new verse until the next day
- The app remembers your verse even if you close the browser
