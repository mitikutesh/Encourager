## Project Overview

Encourager is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) that delivers daily scripture verses to church members via QR code scanning. The app enforces a "one blessing per day" rule — users receive one verse and must click "Amen" to lock it in; subsequent visits that day show a reflection view with countdown to midnight.
